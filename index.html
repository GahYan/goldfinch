<h1> Gold Finch Blog </h1>
<h2> About </h2>
<p> I chose to read The Goldfinch because Ms. Chapman said it was like Catcher in the Rye but better. Catcher in the Rye is
    considered a very good book, so the Goldfinch is probably spectacular. I also thought I might benefit from reading a coming
    of age novel, being on the verge of becoming an adult. (Today is my seventeenth birthday.) Mostly I read web articles about
    programming and physics. But when I read stories I like books with darker tone like Slaughterhouse Five or L'Etranger. I am expecting the Goldfinch to be a bit lighter.

<p> So far, the narrator has been recounting the story from an apartment in Amsterdam. He is a New Yorker. He was very fond
    of his mother and describes how beautiful she was in face and character. He speaks of her as if he was in love with her.
    He blames himself for her death. So far, the book is full of imagery and poetic language, and it has a melancholy tone. He     describes the strangeness of being surrounded by the Dutch language and being in a foreign country, but he seems to be         calm about it.
