<h2> About </h2>
<p> I chose to read The Goldfinch because Ms. Chapman said it was like Catcher in the Rye but better. Catcher in the Rye is
    considered a very good book, so the Goldfinch is probably spectacular. I also thought I might benefit from reading a coming
    of age novel, being on the verge of becoming an adult. (Today is my seventeenth birthday.) Mostly I read web articles about
    programming and physics. But when I read stories I like books with darker tone like Slaughterhouse Five or L'Etranger. I am expecting the Goldfinch to be a bit lighter.

<h2> First Post: December 11, 2017, pages 1-3 </h2>
<p> So far, the narrator has been recounting the story from an apartment in Amsterdam. He is a New Yorker. He was very fond
    of his mother and describes how beautiful she was in face and character. He speaks of her as if he was in love with her.
    He blames himself for her death. So far, the book is full of imagery and poetic language, and it has a melancholy tone.
    He describes the strangeness of being surrounded by the Dutch language and being in a foreign country, but he seems to 
    be calm about it. It is clear that the narrator feels confined in the apartment as he says "Chaotic room-service trays; 
    too many cigarettes; lukewarm vodka from duty free. During those restless, shut-up days, I got to know every inch of the 
    room as a prisoner comes to know his cell. " He almost has a tone of resignation. The tone is very different from Holden 
    Caulfield's as it is much less abrasive and more mature. The age of the narrator is unclear, but I would say that it is 
    awfully elaborate and sophisticated for a teenager. This book is much different from stories I usually read, since it has
    a softer feeling. But it is only the first few pages. I am sure it will pick up.
