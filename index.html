<h1> Gold Finch Blog </h1>
<h2> About </h2>
<p> I chose to read The Goldfinch because Ms. Chapman said it was like Catcher in the Rye but better. Catcher in the Rye is
    considered a very good book, so the Goldfinch is probably spectacular. I also thought I might benefit from reading a coming
    of age novel, being on the verge of becoming an adult. (Today is my seventeenth birthday.) Mostly I read web articles about
    programming and physics. But when I read stories I like books with darker tone like Slaughterhouse Five or L'Etranger. I am expecting the Goldfinch to be a bit lighter.

<h2> First Post: December 11, 2017, pages 1-3 </h2>
<p> So far, the narrator has been recounting the story from an apartment in Amsterdam. He is a New Yorker. He was very fond
    of his mother and describes how beautiful she was in face and character. He speaks of her as if he was in love with her.
    He blames himself for her death. So far, the book is full of imagery and poetic language, and it has a melancholy tone.
    He describes the strangeness of being surrounded by the Dutch language and being in a foreign country, but he seems to 
    be calm about it. It is clear that the narrator feels confined in the apartment as he says "Chaotic room-service trays; 
    too many cigarettes; lukewarm vodka from duty free. During those restless, shut-up days, I got to know every inch of the 
    room as a prisoner comes to know his cell. " He almost has a tone of resignation. The tone is very different from Holden 
    Caulfield's as it is much less abrasive and more mature. The age of the narrator is unclear, but I would say that it is 
    awfully elaborate and sophisticated for a teenager. This book is much different from stories I usually read, since it has
    a softer feeling. But it is only the first few pages. I am sure it will pick up.

<h2> Second Post: December 12, 2017, The Boy With the Skull</h2>
<p> Theo describes his trip with his mother (who was an art major) to the museum. She explains her favorite pieces to him. The narrator catches sight of a girl and an old man, and he is strangely drawn to her. When Theo's mother leaves to see The Anatomy Lesson again, a bomb goes off. He wakes up in the rubble next to the old man. The older man places a ring in Theo’s hand and tells him “Hobart and Blackwell" and to ring the green bell. The old man dies. He cannot find his mother and he tries to convince himself that she made her way home. One of the main themes that comes up in the passage that I read is time. The mother had the passage of time in her mind. Theo has limited time to spend with his mother before she dies. He hopes to waste time in the museum to skip the parent meeting at his school. He mentions how some memories seem stuck in time and wonders if that is the case with his brief experience with the red headed girl. One thing that I have noticed is that Theo uses many analogies and metaphors when he speaks. For example he says that he was like "like a servant boy in a story" when he was helping the old man after the bombing. I can relate to this because often events remind me of other things from my own life, or movies and books that I've seen.

<h2> Third Post: December 13, 2017, The Anatomy Lesson</h2>
<p> 
    Theo goes back to his apartment which is the designated meeting place in the case of an emergency. He cannot find his       mother, and calls emergency services to find out where his mother is and whether or not she is OK. There is no available    information. He waits awhile, and he gets a call that says that there is an emergency and asks where his father is. He      lies and says that his father went out. Some time later, two social workers go to his apartment. I like how in the story    the narrator describes things in deep detail and even mentions things that do not seem to matter. I think this is an        honest way of showing how one is thinking and feeling, because usually we think and feel in a pretty messy way. The part    when Theo lies about where his father is, is a good moment to show character traits. It is clear that Theo in not            trusting towards adults and authority figures, and that is reinforced with his misbehavior at school. He probably feels      this way because of his hard life growing up with a neglectful father. I think it is interesting how he tells the            seemingly unrelated story of how his father left to "start a new life". This foreshadows the end of the chapter when the    social workers show up at his door and he knew that "life as [he] knew it was over." Foreshadowing was a tool that the      author used in the first chapter when Theo tells how his mother said it was so sad how people had to die, and then many      people die by the end of the first chapter (perhaps even the mother.)
