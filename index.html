<h2 id = "about"> About </h2>
<p> I chose to read The Goldfinch because Ms. Chapman said it was like Catcher in the Rye but better. Catcher in the Rye is
    considered a very good book, so the Goldfinch is probably spectacular. I also thought I might benefit from reading a coming
    of age novel, being on the verge of becoming an adult. (Today is my seventeenth birthday.) Mostly I read web articles about
    programming and physics. But when I read stories I like books with darker tone like Slaughterhouse Five or L'Etranger. I am expecting the Goldfinch to be a bit lighter.

She first gained inspiration for the novel during a trip to Amsterdam in 1993. She says that she wrote much of the Goldfinch in the New York Public Library, writing with pen on paper. The "Dickensian" feel of the Goldfinch comes from Tart's childhood in Grenada.

<h2> First Post: December 11, 2017, pages 1-3 </h2>
<p> So far, the narrator has been recounting the story from an apartment in Amsterdam. He is a New Yorker. He was very fond
    of his mother and describes how beautiful she was in face and character. He speaks of her as if he was in love with her.
    He blames himself for her death. So far, the book is full of imagery and poetic language, and it has a melancholy tone.
    He describes the strangeness of being surrounded by the Dutch language and being in a foreign country, but he seems to 
    be calm about it. It is clear that the narrator feels confined in the apartment as he says "Chaotic room-service trays; 
    too many cigarettes; lukewarm vodka from duty free. During those restless, shut-up days, I got to know every inch of the 
    room as a prisoner comes to know his cell. " He almost has a tone of resignation. The tone is very different from Holden 
    Caulfield's as it is much less abrasive and more mature. The age of the narrator is unclear, but I would say that it is 
    awfully elaborate and sophisticated for a teenager. This book is much different from stories I usually read, since it has
    a softer feeling. But it is only the first few pages. I am sure it will pick up.

<h2> Second Post: December 12, 2017, The Boy With the Skull</h2>
<p> Theo describes his trip with his mother (who was an art major) to the museum. She explains her favorite pieces to him. The narrator catches sight of a girl and an old man, and he is strangely drawn to her. When Theo's mother leaves to see The Anatomy Lesson again, a bomb goes off. He wakes up in the rubble next to the old man. The older man places a ring in Theo’s hand, tells him to take the Goldfinch painting and tells him “Hobart and Blackwell" and to ring the green bell. The old man dies. He cannot find his mother and he tries to convince himself that she made her way home. One of the main themes that comes up in the passage that I read is time. The mother had the passage of time in her mind. Theo has limited time to spend with his mother before she dies. He hopes to waste time in the museum to skip the parent meeting at his school. He mentions how some memories seem stuck in time and wonders if that is the case with his brief experience with the red headed girl. One thing that I have noticed is that Theo uses many analogies and metaphors when he speaks. For example he says that he was like "like a servant boy in a story" when he was helping the old man after the bombing. I can relate to this because often events remind me of other things from my own life, or movies and books that I've seen.
</p>
<h2> Third Post: December 13, 2017, The Anatomy Lesson</h2>
<p> 
    Theo goes back to his apartment which is the designated meeting place in the case of an emergency. He cannot find his       mother, and calls emergency services to find out where his mother is and whether or not she is OK. There is no available    information. He waits awhile, and he gets a call that says that there is an emergency and asks where his father is. He      lies and says that his father went out. Some time later, two social workers go to his apartment. I like how in the story    the narrator describes things in deep detail and even mentions things that do not seem to matter. I think this is an        honest way of showing how one is thinking and feeling, because usually we think and feel in a pretty messy way. The part    when Theo lies about where his father is, is a good moment to show character traits. It is clear that Theo in not            trusting towards adults and authority figures, and that is reinforced with his misbehavior at school. He probably feels      this way because of his hard life growing up with a neglectful father. I think it is interesting how he tells the            seemingly unrelated story of how his father left to "start a new life". This foreshadows the end of the chapter when the    social workers show up at his door and he knew that "life as [he] knew it was over." Foreshadowing was a tool that the      author used in the first chapter when Theo tells how his mother said it was so sad how people had to die, and then many      people die by the end of the first chapter (perhaps even the mother.)
</p>

<h2> Fourth Post: December 14, 2017, Park Avenue</h2>
<p> 
    The social workers tell Theo that his mother is dead. Theo requests to stay with his friend, Andy Barbour and his family. They are kind to him and protect him from unneccasary questioning. Theo return to school and tries to go back to normal. At school, two investigators ask him about what he witnessed in the crime scene. He is worried because he has stolen the Goldfinch painting. One Sunday, Theo has a flashback of the sentence "Hobart and Blackwell. Ring the bell" that the old man had said before. He finds those names in the White Pages. With Andy's encouragement he walks over to Hobart and Blackwell's building. A man named Hobie opens the door. A thing I have noticed in this chapter is the class difference between Theo and Andy's family. Theo describes there house has "opulent" and having a servant for everything. Although the Barbours are wealthy, money concious, and snobbish people, especially Mr. Barbour who likes to "go sailing" and reads the "financial times", they are also kind to Theo, treating him as their own child and looking after him. Andy is also a bit of a foil for Theo's character. While Theo is unscholarly and raised to be a bit tough, Andy is a rich kid who seems to be very talented and focused academically.

    Theo visits Hobie who was the Business partner of "Welty" Blackwell, Pippa's (the red headed girl at the museum) guardian. Theo Visits pippa a few times (and gets kissed by her) until her Aunt Margaret moves her to Texas. At the end of the chapter, Theo's father and his girlfriend Xandra come to take him back with them to Las Vegas. When they visit Theo's mother's apartment, he gives the Goldfinch painting to the doormen for safe keeping. In this chapter, I noticed that the author uses a lot of figurative language which adds to the emotional experience of reading the book. For example after Theo kisses Pippa and learns that she is leaving to go to Texas he describes his feelings as "my head in the rainclouds, my heart in the sky." This perfectly expresses the bittersweet feeling of infatuation without fulfilment. Theo's relationship to Pippa is strangely close, considering how well they know each other. She is one of the only people (besides Hobie) that he willing speaks to about his mother. I think it is interesting how similar the name "Pippa" is to "Pippy Longstocking". The two characters are similar in that they are both red-headed and orphaned. Theo bonds with characters in this chapter because of similar life experiences. Both Theo and Hobie came from not wealthy backgrounds and had abusive fathers. Pippa and Theo both experienced loss of a parental figure, and they both are not certain where they are going or who will take care of them. This book is getting interesting. Ms. Chapman said the book picks up pace after this chapter. I'm looking forward to it.

<h2> Sixth Post: January 4, 2018, Badr Al-Dine</h2>
<p> 
   Theo's father and Xandra take Theo to his home in Las Vegas where Theo's father is a professional gambler. He becomes good friends with a Russian-Polish-Australian-Indonesian-Ukranian boy named Boris. Boris drinks often (Theo picks up this habit too.) and has an abusive father who beats him severely. Boris and Theo become inseparable and engage in shoplifting, smoking, and drinking. Boris stays over often at Theo's father's house. The chapter is named after Boris' Muslim name, "Badr Al-Dine". Boris claims that it means moon. Theo recalls the time his mother told him to look at the moon when he is homesick, because the moon is the same everywhere. It is fitting that Boris in named after the moon, since he has to make home in so many places around the world. I think Boris one of the main things that make Las Vegas "home" for Theo. This says something about friendships in general. Home is where your friends are. Theo's friendship with Boris is very different from his friendship with Andy Barbour, in that he is much less polite with Boris than he is with Andy. I think there was something in the "perfection" of Andy's life that Theo could not relate with. He described high society as being restrained. With Boris, Theo can be fully honest. Boris is one of the few people in the story that has had a harder life than Theo's.

<h2> Seventh Post: January 5, 2018, Wind, Sand, and Stars</h2>
<p> 
   Theo gets used to living with his father, Xandra, and Boris in Las Vegas. However, Boris and Theo's relationship grows a little bit strained when Boris starts to date Kotku, an older girl. Theo's father owes money to a man named Mr. Silver who comes to their house often. Mr. Decker forces Theo to call the family lawyer and asks for money from Theo's trust fund (that Theo didn't know about.) Not too long after, Mr. Decker is killed in a car accident. Theo flees to New York and goes to Hobie's house. Throughout this chapter, his guilt about the Goldfinch painting haunts him. He is paranoid that someone will find out about it and takes special care to hide it. The bird in the painting reflects Theo's circumstances "fluttering briefly, forced always to land in the same hopeless place". In the last two chapters, Theo's character has changed dramatically. Before, he was going to a fancy intellectual public school and liked by adults and in Las Vegas, he skips school and trips heavily on drugs. I think he is becoming desensitized to life's issues. Like many adolescents he is developing an attitude of apathy and a hatred toward social expectations and requirements. At the end of the chapter, when he makes a phone call to Xandra, she tells him that he is more like his father than he might think. One can see the similarities between Theo and Mr. Decker. Both of them are substance abusers and apathetic toward the death of a family member. Interestingly enough, the quote for the next part of the book is "We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others, that in the end, we become disguised to ourselves (François de la Rochefoucauld)." What will save Theo Decker from destroying himself?
</p>
<h2> Eighth Post: January 7, 2018, The Shop Behind the Shop</h2>
<p> 
    Theo moves in with Hobie, who becomes his temporary legal guardian. He finds out that the family lawyer, Mr. Bracegirdle could have wired him the money that his father forced him to call for, but didn't because he "smelled a rat". Theo attends an early college school where he does not participate much and works the bare minimum. As a few art thieves get found out, Theo becomes anxious about the Goldfinch painting and moves it to a secure storage locker. He tries to visit the apartment doormen, but the building is being renovated. I think Theo returns to an old environment and finds himself changed. He is more grown up, but still lost and without stability. I have noticed how influenced he is by the people in his life. He thinks of Popper as "Popchyk", he uses "Russianate" hand gestures, takes up antique cabinet restoration, and listens to his mother's playlist. While Theo has lost some of his innocence and must mature, Pippa is still very childlike and colorful. Theo feels isolated and he feels that after everything he has been through with the drugs and wild life and both parents dead, he cannot find meaning in life. Hobie is the most caring parental figure in Theo's life since his mother. Theo has transitioned into a much more comfortable life, perhaps similar to that of a normal sixteen year old.

<h2> Ninth Post: January 8, 2018, Everything of Possibility and The Idiot (Part 4)</h2>
<p> 
    The story jumps eight years. Theo still works for Hobie. He runs the business, and he scams customers by selling them Hobie's reconstructed pieces as originals. He runs into Platt, Andy's brother and finds out that Mr. Barbour and Andy have died. He reconnects with the Barbour family. Theo and Kitsey Barbour get engaged. Theo has sold a fake to a man name Lucius Reeves who keeps pressing him. They meet together, and Reeves asks Theo where the Goldfinch Painting is. In the street, Theo runs into Boris who tells him that he stole the painting in Las Vegas, but no longer knows where it is. Theo finds out that Kitsey is cheating on him with Tom Cable. Pippa comes back from London and spends time with Theo. The chapter ends with Boris taking Theo somewhere in order to locate the Goldfinch painting. I think a main theme in this part of the book is the idea of worth and authenticity. Theo learns from his scam business that the correct price of an object is not its list price but rather the price people are willing to pay. The scam business reflects his relationship to Kitsey. It is beneficial financially and perhaps socially, but it is just an elaborate act. Similar to believing that he had the Goldfinch when really it was stolen away, Theo thinks and tricks himself into believing that what he had with Kitsey is real, but especially after meeting Pippa again, he realizes that it does not truly satisfy him. I think it is interesting how Theo describes the cover of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan cover, how "they could be going anywhere". With Pippa, the world is bright and the possibilities are endless, but with Kitsey, it seems that everything is planned already (especially the neurotically planned wedding). This part of the book reflects the Rouchefoucald quote. Theo lies to others, and more importantly to himself.
