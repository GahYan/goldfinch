<h1> Gold Finch Blog </h1>
<h2> First Post: December 11, 2017 </h2>
<p> I chose to read The Goldfinch because Ms. Chapman said it was like Catcher in the Rye but better. Catcher in the Rye is
    considered a very good book, so the Goldfinch is probably spectacular. I also thought I might benefit from reading a coming
    of age novel, being on the verge of becoming an adult. (Today is my seventeenth birthday.) Mostly I read web articles about
    programming and physics. But when I read stories I like books with darker tone like Slaughterhouse Five or L'Etranger. I am expecting the Goldfinch to be a bit lighter.
